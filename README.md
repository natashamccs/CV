## Natasha McIntyre

Determined, reliable and resilient, I am a full stack software developer, a career changer who has graduated from the Makers bootcamp and I am very excited about embarking on a new career in tech. As an ex musician, maths teacher and exams officer, I will bring my creativity, curiosity, interpersonal skills, attention to detail, and my passion for puzzles, challenge and progression to my role to influence a diverse approach to the design of technologies. My aim is to work collaboratively to increase efficiency and to expedite and develop technology for the benefit of society. I believe in building well tested products with high quality code.

## Skills

#### Problem solving and collaboration skills

- I am confident in solving problems by breaking them down. In software development I have done this by taking a product description, breaking it down into user stories and then further dissecting the user stories into smaller components - a particular focus whilst building [Book Me Up](https://github.com/natashamcintyre/book_swap). As a maths teacher, it might involve simplifying a problem and building it up gradually, finding patterns, or exploring a problem by trying multiple approaches in order to fully understand a best approach. These are all powerful techniques when faced with Further Maths A Level questions and also all applicable to coding. As a software developer, I am particularly enjoying solving problems using test-driven development.
- All of the challenges in the Makers course have required some sort of problem solving skills, whether it is how to work best together as a team, prioritising feature development or debugging to find the root cause of an error. I can apply the collaboration skills I use as a musician and the interpersonal skills I used a teacher to effective team work, my time management skills which I have developed in high pressure environments to assist with prioritisation, and my mathematical problem solving skills have proven invaluable for debugging.
- Having spoken to frustrated colleagues about data entry submissions in my role as Assistant Examinations Officer, I decided to solve the problem by building a spreadsheet to make the whole process faster, using automation to eliminate repetition and load relevant data accordingly. I used feedback from staff to continually improve it and it has now been incorporated into the standard systems. This continual feedback and improvement loop is fundamental to learn effectively and one which I have repeatedly used as a musician, a teacher and a software developer.
- Frequent use of pastoral care problem solving skills to support students' learning and overall wellbeing.

#### Organisational, analytical and resilience skills

- The Makers course is an intensive bootcamp focused on deep learning of core programming concepts with the aim of becoming language agnostic. The course demanded superior self-learning skills, effective time management, persistance and resilience, high-quality agile teamwork and strong motivation for independent projects.
- Reflecting at the end of each project enabled me to analyse my progress and identify areas for improvement, which I could then focus on in the next project. For example, having identified that test-driven development was a priority, we incorporated it as one of the primary goals in the [Book Me Up](https://github.com/natashamcintyre/book_swap) project.
- These are also crucial skills to be an effective teacher. Every lesson requires detailed planning for groups and on an individual level. Daily use of analytical skills to assess the success of an approach, and resilience and the ability to call upon multiple alternative strategies when approaches did not fully work.
- Multiple examples of clients achieving and exceeding goals across all year groups throughout my career.
- Good musicians also make high use of these skills, especially discipline, resilience and self analysis in independent practice.

#### Communication, collaboration and leadership skills

- I have worked in an agile team to build and develop multiple projects. In [Book Me Up](https://github.com/natashamcintyre/book_swap), our higher order learning goals included supporting each other by sharing knowledge after pair programming sprints, being honest and reaching out to the team when blocked, and presenting our product at the live online Demo Day. We rotated roles such that all members of the team had the opportunity to develop leadership, coaching and support skills.
- I can communicate with a wide variety of people across multiple age ranges and in a variety of working relationships, both within the business and with clients, including sensitive topics.
- I am familiar and able to perform under pressure, which I have done regularly both as a musician and teacher.
- I have successfully worked with individuals who needed a confidence boost to improve their piano skills, as well as supported newly qualified teachers through the frequent practical and emotional challenges they face.

## Experience
