## About Me :wave:

Collaborative, resilient and adaptable, I am a full stack software developer with a passion for solving problems and creating effective and simple solutions. I thoroughly enjoy puzzles, challenge, languages and learning, and I employ creativity, curiousity and attention to detail to my work. I believe in building well-tested products, balancing high-quality code with speed, that deliver business and client value.

## Skills :bow_and_arrow:

#### Problem solving skills

- I am confident in solving problems by breaking them down, both at the implementation stage using test-driven development, and at the planning stage. Feature leading has been an exciting and fantastic experience to enable me to apply problem solving skills to software. I have worked with stakeholders to research and identify problems and their needs, collaborated closely with the design team to find sleek, simple solutions that meet requirements, sought feedback, guidance and offered opinions during technical decision making, broken features down into small but impactful tickets, reviewed code, ensured requirements have been met and offered alternative suggestions and learning implementation decisions along the way, taking responsibility for any changes occuring during the build.
- As a maths teacher, problem solving might involve simplifying a problem and building it up gradually, finding patterns, or exploring a problem by trying multiple approaches in order to fully understand a best approach. These are all powerful techniques when faced with Further Maths A Level questions and also all applicable to the development challenges I enjoy solving on a daily basis.
- I've expedited processes using automation to eliminate repetition and load relevant data accordingly, using feedback to constantly improve. This continual feedback and improvement loop is fundamental to learn effectively and one which I have used repeatedly as a musician, a teacher and a software developer.
- Frequent use of pastoral care problem solving skills to support students' learning and overall wellbeing.

#### Organisational, analytical and resilience skills

- I am able to balance and prioritise various responsibilities, including feature leading, mentoring, shipping changes, reviewing code, maintaining upgrades and contributing to tech strategy.
- I show resilience and can respond to last minute changes and the detours that come with working at a start up.
- Feedback and reflection enable me to analyse my progress and identify areas for improvement and set goals accordingly. For example, I identified contributing to technical decision making as an area to improve and joined the tech strategy team to learn about the process and offer my thoughts.
- The Makers course demanded superior self-learning skills, effective time management, persistence and resilience, high-quality agile teamwork and strong motivation for independent projects.
- These are also crucial skills to be an effective teacher. Every lesson requires detailed planning for groups and on an individual level. Daily use of analytical skills to assess the success of an approach, and resilience and the ability to call upon multiple alternative strategies when approaches did not fully work.
- Multiple examples of clients achieving and exceeding goals across all year groups throughout my career.
- Good musicians also make high use of these skills, especially discipline, resilience and self analysis in independent practice.

#### Communication, collaboration and leadership skills

- I am mentoring a peer as they are transitioning from data engineering to their first role as a product engineer. This requires using my teaching skills in pairing sessions to guide them to find solutions, deepen understanding and encourage them to question assumptions, as well as giving feedback on progress to increase confidence and aid them in identifying and boosting areas of improvement.
- I have worked in a cross-functional, agile team with a mixture of independent work, pairing and mobbing. I apply the collaboration skills I use as a musician and the interpersonal skills I used a teacher to ensure effective teamwork, and my time management skills which I have developed in high pressure environments to assist with prioritisation. 
- Regularly leading features, I have worked closely with stakeholders, third parties, product managers, the design team and fellow developers to find elegant and simple solutions to problems. This has required listening, offering suggestions, asking for honest feedback and maintaining open lines of communication with all parties throughout.
- In [Book Me Up](https://github.com/natashamcintyre/CV/blob/master/README.md#Projects), our higher order learning goals included supporting each other by sharing knowledge after pair programming sprints, being honest and reaching out to the team when blocked, and presenting our product at the live online Demo Day. We rotated roles such that all members of the team had the opportunity to develop leadership, coaching and support skills.
- I can communicate with a wide variety of people across multiple age ranges and in a variety of working relationships, both within the business and with clients, including sensitive topics.
- I am familiar and able to perform under pressure, which I have done regularly both as a musician and teacher.
- I have successfully worked with individuals who needed a confidence boost to improve their piano and mathematical skills, as well as supported newly qualified teachers through the frequent practical and emotional challenges they face.
