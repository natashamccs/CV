## Natasha McIntyre

Determined, reliable and resilient, I am a full stack software developer excited about embarking on a new career in tech. As an ex musician, maths teacher and exams officer, I will bring my creativity, my curiosity and my passion for puzzles, challenge and progression to my role to influence a diverse approach to the design of technologies. My aim is to work collaboratively to increase efficiency and to expedite and develop technology for the benefit of society. I believe in building well tested products with good quality code and close attention to detail.

## Experience

**Projects at Makers Academy** (Oct 2020 to Feb 2021)
_Student_

- Built imitations of several well-known services, including Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Airbnb, some collaboratively and some individually.
- Worked in an agile team to develop the beginnings of a book sharing app, Book Me Up, in an entirely new tech stack in just two weeks. We focused on using a high-quality test-driven development process and sharing our learnings across the team to ensure all team members understood all parts of the code.
- Taught myself how to use Active Record outside of Rails.
- I have 2 projects lined up to add Python and Django to my toolbelt, as well as building a mobile app with React Native.

**St Margaret's School** (Sept 2017 to Aug 2020)  
_Assistant Examinations Officer and Teacher of Maths_

- Effective collaboration with colleagues to share good practices, as well as strong independent working skills. Developed Excel files to expedite administrative tasks for school examinations. Constant user of technology in the classroom. My multiple responsibilities required the ability to manage high pressure in a fast-paced environment.

**Mill Hill County High School** (Sept 2010 to Aug 2014)  
_Assistant Head of Year 12-13 and Teacher of Maths_

- Applied strong organisation and empathetic skills to my roles, which included overall responsibility for all sixth form students, effective teaching to a wide variety of students as well as leadership and support roles on the school's ski, sport and Duke of Edinburgh trips.

## Skills

#### Problem solving skills

- I am confident in taking a product description, breaking it down into user stories and then further dissecting the user stories into smaller components. This was a particular focus whilst building Book Me Up.
- All of the challenges in the Makers course have required some sort of problem solving skills, whether it is how to work best together as a team, breaking tasks down or finding solutions to coding problems. I am particularly enjoying solving problems using TDD.
- As a teacher, I used mathematical problem solving skills on a daily basis, including Further Maths A Level.
- Having spoken to frustrated colleagues about data entry submissions in my role as Assistant Examinations Officer, I decided to build a spreadsheet to make the whole process faster, by using automation to eliminate repetition and load relevant data accordingly. I used feedback from staff to continually improve it and it has now been incorporated into the standard systems.
- As part of that same role, I created a "clash" spreadsheet to expedite my individual timetabling task.
- Frequent use of pastoral care problem solving skills to support students' learning and overall wellbeing.

#### Organisational, analytical and resilience skills

- The Makers course is an intensive bootcamp focused on deep learning of core programming concepts with the aim of becoming language agnostic. The course demanded superior self-learning skills, effective time management, persistance and resilience, high-quality agile teamwork and strong motivation for independent projects.
- Reflecting at the end of each project enabled me to analyse my progress and identify areas for improvement, which I could then focus on in the next project. For example, I identified the test-driven development process as a key area I wanted to focus on, which was one of the primary goals in the final project (Book Me Up).
- These are also crucial skills to be an effective teacher. Every lesson requires detailed planning for groups and on an individual level. Daily use of analytical skills to assess the success of an approach, and resilience and the ability to call upon multiple alternative strategies when approaches did not fully work.
- Multiple examples of clients achieving and exceeding goals across all year groups throughout my career.

#### Presentation, explanation and communication skills

- I have worked in an agile team to build and develop multiple projects. The higher order learning goal included supporting each other by sharing knowledge after pair programming sprints, being honest and reaching out to the team when blocked, and presenting our product at the live online Demo Day.
- I can communicate with a wide variety of people across multiple age ranges and in a variety of working relationships, both within the business and with clients, including sensitive topics.
- I contributed to the growth of the department resources and good practices within the maths departments at both workplaces.
