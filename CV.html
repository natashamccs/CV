          Working in agile, cross-functional teams in multiple formats and
          sizes, I successfully lead features, collaborating and facilitating
          decision making, overseeing the build and using retrospectives to
          reflect, share and receive feedback both for my learning and the
          team's growth. I review code in consideration of best practices, using
          the discussion to generate learning opportunities, and am mentoring a
          peer in their first role as a product engineer. I am also leading the
          tech strategy initiative, I deliver learning sessions internally and
